this is my personal portfolio website, made using nextjs

i decided to use nextjs because i wanted to learn full stack development and 
i believe that the nextjs framework would offer this opportunity for me to do so.

this project is still work in progress

i'm very commited to this project, so it would be appreciated if you could give me your support as i learn a javascript framework while creating my website!

to install the required dependencies, do:
```
npm install
```

made with nextjs: https://github.com/vercel/next.js
