# Navbar
This component serves as a navigation bar for users to navigate their way through the page with ease. It brings the user to links such as:
- Home Page (the link on the left)
- Experience Page 
- Projects Page
- Education Page

The following modules are imported to bring in the required icons and fonts used for this Navbar:
```
import Link from 'next/link';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
import { FiMenu } from "react-icons/fi";
import { RxCross1 } from "react-icons/rx";
```

When using useState, since it is a server-side component, it is important to put the following at the top of the page:
```
"use client"
```

This tells react that the component is being used on the client side.

The usage of use client is for the mobile menu.
