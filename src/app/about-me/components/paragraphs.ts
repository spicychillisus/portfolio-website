Hi! My name is Asher, and I'm currently a student at Singapore Polytechnic pursuing a Diploma in Information Technology.

The journey to where I am today has been a long one, and I'm proud of the progress I've made so far.
I've always been passionate about technology and the way it can be used to solve problems and make life easier for everyone.
I've spent hours learning about different technologies and programming languages, and I'm always looking for new things to learn.

My journey started when I was 15, which is when I first learnt about the wonders of programming and technology.
Before that, technology was just a tool that I used in my daily life, such as my computer or my phone.
After learning about programming, I realised that technology could be so much more than just a tool.
The first programming languages I learnt were HTML and CSS, and I was amazed at how I could create websites from scratch.
I spent most of the lockdown in 2020 learning about HTML and CSS, and even created a simple website using them.\

Sadly, I halted my learning journey after that, as I had to shift my focus back to academics.

Somewhere at the end of 2020, a new Drama series called "Start-Up" was released on Netflix.
The series was about a group of young entrepreneurs who were trying to make it big in the tech industry.
This series reignited my passion for technology and programming, and I decided to start learning again, as I
was inspired by the characters in the series. This lead to me choosing the Information Technology course in Singapore Polytechnic.
